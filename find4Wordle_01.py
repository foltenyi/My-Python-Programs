This program will give suggestions which word to give to the Wordle game.
If you entered the first word, just enter the first letters of the colors the computer
answered. If you entered a different word, prepend it. E.g. for 5 letter words:
bgbyy        - if you entered the first (or only) suggested word
frame gbyby  - if you entered 'frame', not the first of the suggested word
If "Try to eliminate letters ..." printed, the interpretation of
(word n) - if give word, n letters will be checked; if a letter occurs
    multiple times, it counted multiple times.
If the solution word was not found, please add it to the words storage, which
can be a text file, order doesn't matter, but try to keep it ordered.
If the suggested word was not accepted by Wordle, please delete it, or
comment out by puting '#' in the first column.
For adding / deleting / editing words in the SQLite database you can use
DB Browser for SQLite utility program.
